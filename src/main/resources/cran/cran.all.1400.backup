We are so thankful for our members â arXiv would not be possible without their support. arXiv members are universities, research labs, libraries, and consortia that contribute funding to arXiv to help advance the cause of open science. Other funding for arXiv comes from foundations, affiliates, and sponsors. Interested in supporting arXiv and expanding the possibilities of open science? Learn more about arXiv's funding and contact us at membership@arXiv.org. arXiv gratefully acknowledges the consortia across the globe who represent the best interests of their constituents by collectively supporting arXiv and open science. Champion consortia support arXiv by giving above and beyond in the name of open science. Champion members with arXiv are institutions whose researchers are top users of arXiv and whose goal is to lead the global research community in innovation, education, and promoting open science. Top Submitters are institutions who are globally ranked as the top users of arXiv. Frequent Submitters are members whose researchers frequently submit scholarly articles to arXiv. Regular Submitters are members whose researchers regularly submit scholarly articles to arXiv. Community members are institutions who primarily use arXiv for reading articles, rather than submitting, or who may be resource-limited, but would still like to give to arXiv.We are so thankful for our members â arXiv would not be possible without their support. arXiv members are universities, research labs, libraries, and consortia that contribute funding to arXiv to help advance the cause of open science.

arXiv is a curated research-sharing platform open to anyone. As a pioneer in digital open access, arXiv.org now hosts more than two million scholarly articles in eight subject areas, curated by our strong community of volunteer moderators. arXiv offers researchers a broad range of services: article submission, compilation, production, retrieval, search and discovery, web distribution for human readers, and API access for machines, together with content curation and preservation. Our emphasis on openness, collaboration, and scholarship provide the strong foundation on which arXiv thrives. arXiv currently serves the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. arXiv was founded by Paul Ginsparg in 1991 and is now maintained and operated by Cornell Tech. Operations are maintained by the arXiv Leadership Team and arXiv staff at Cornell University. Governance of arXiv is led by the Leadership Team with guidance from the arXiv Editorial Advisory Council, Institutions Advisory Council, and Science Advisory Council. arXiv is a community-supported resource funded by Cornell University, the Simons Foundation, member institutions, and donors. Registered users may submit articles to be announced by arXiv. There are no fees or costs for article submission. Submissions to arXiv are subject to a moderation process that classifies material as topical to the subject area and checks for scholarly value. Material is not peer-reviewed by arXiv - the contents of arXiv submissions are wholly the responsibility of the submitter and are presented âas isâ without any warranty or guarantee. By hosting works and other materials on this site, arXiv, Cornell University, and their agents do not in any way convey implied approval of the assumptions, methods, results, or conclusions of the work.arXiv is a curated research-sharing platform open to anyone.
